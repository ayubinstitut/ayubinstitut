- 👋 Hi, I’m @ayubinstitut
- 👀 I’m interested in mathematics and machine learning especially neural networks
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Fullstack Development to launch my own website because i teach a lot of students 
- in school and university mathematics to pay for my university costs
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building a home for everyone trying to get a deeper understanding of maths or just pass their exams
- my vision for ayubinstitut is for it to be a place where people who are frustrated in their first semesters of university can go 
- to realize that acing math exams in university and understanding math is actually not as difficult as it may appear at first and 
- hopefully in the future ayubinstitut can be a place for people all around the world who are less fortunate and may not have great 
- schools around them to learn maths and widen their horizon and knowledge
- 📫 How to reach me shoot me an email: aminayub@outlook.com
